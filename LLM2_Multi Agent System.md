explore key components of multi-agent systems:

- Role-playing: Assign specialized roles to agents
- Memory: Provide agents with short-term, - long-term, and shared memory
- Tools: Assign pre-built and custom tools to each agent (e.g. for web search)
- Focus: Break down the tasks, goals, and tools and assign to multiple AI agents for better performance
- Guardrails: Effectively handle errors, hallucinations, and infinite loops
- Cooperation: Perform tasks in series, in parallel, and hierarchically
