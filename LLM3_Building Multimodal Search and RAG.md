Learn how to build multimodal search and RAG systems.

- Learn how multimodal models are trained through contrastive learning and implement it on a real dataset.
- Build any-to-any multimodal search to retrieve relevant context across different data types.
- Learn how LLMs are trained to understand multimodal data through visual instruction tuning and use them on multiple image reasoning examples
- Implement an end-to-end multimodal RAG system that analyzes retrieved multimodal context to generate insightful answers
- Explore industry applications like visually analyzing invoices and flowcharts to output structured data.
- Create a multi-vector recommender system that suggests relevant items by comparing their similarities across multiple modalities.
