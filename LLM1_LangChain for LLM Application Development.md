===

Course Link - [LangChain](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-for-llm-application-development/)

topics:

- Models, Prompts and Parsers: calling LLMs, providing prompts and parsing the response
- Memories for LLMs: memories to store conversations and manage limited context space
- Chains: creating sequences of operations
- Question Answering over Documents: apply LLMs to your proprietary data and use case requirements
- Agents: explore the powerful emerging development of LLM as reasoning agents.
